I'm an avid artificial intelligence researcher passionate with forest stuff. I grew up in Québec, Canada and went a few times out of the country to places without maple syrup! I develop technologies towards precision forestry in hopes of better environment preservation. 

- 🌍 PhD student at [Norlab](https://norlab.ulaval.ca/) working on tree detection algorithms.
- 🌱 My goal is to improve the applicability of state-of-the-art AI to concrete problems in sustainable forestry.
